      <div><h1>1971 Economic condition</h1>
        <p>In 1971, Bangladesh was undergoing significant economic changes. The country was still in the early stages of its development as an independent nation, having gained independence from Pakistan in December 1971. The economy was primarily agrarian, with agriculture accounting for the majority of employment and GDP. Industry was limited, with a small number of large-scale factories, mainly in textiles and jute. The country was also facing significant challenges, including poverty, food insecurity, and a shortage of resources. The political and economic instability of the time, along with the devastating impact of the Bangladesh Liberation War, led to a period of economic hardship in the early years of Bangladesh's independence.</p></div>

        <div><h1>Recent Economic condition</h1>
            <!-- Content-2 -->

            <p>The recent economic condition of Bangladesh has been characterized by strong growth and improved stability. Over the past decade, the country has experienced an average annual GDP growth rate of around 6%, making it one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. This growth has been driven by a number of factors, including increased foreign investment, a growing workforce, and expansion in key sectors such as garments, telecommunications, and finance.

                Despite this progress, Bangladesh still faces significant economic challenges, including poverty, inequality, and infrastructure gaps. The country has a large informal sector and a large portion of the population still lives below the poverty line. Additionally, Bangladesh is vulnerable to natural disasters, such as floods and cyclones, which can disrupt economic activity and set back progress.</p></div>
